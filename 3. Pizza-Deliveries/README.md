# 🍕 Pizza Deliveries (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python console application that calculates the final price of a pizza based on **size**, **pepperoni**, and **extra cheese** selections.

This project is intended to practice **conditional logic**, **user input**, and **basic price calculation** in Python.

## 📌 Features

* Choose pizza size (Small, Medium, Large)
* Option to add pepperoni
* Option to add extra cheese
* Displays the final bill amount
* Stops execution if an invalid size is selected

## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. The user selects a pizza size (`S`, `M`, or `L`)
2. The user chooses whether to add pepperoni
3. The user chooses whether to add extra cheese
4. The program calculates and prints the final price

If an invalid pizza size is entered, the program displays an error message and exits.
